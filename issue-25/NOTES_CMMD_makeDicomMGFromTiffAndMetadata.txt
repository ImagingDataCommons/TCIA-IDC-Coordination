Make DICOM Digital Mammography X-Ray For Presentation images from supplied TIFF images

Make DICOM images dual-personality DICOM-TIFF (using -tiff option in dicom3tools utilities)

Supplied TIFF images are (almost) all 8 bits and appear to have had windowing applied - keep as 8 bit (which is legal for DICOM MG though unusual)

 - exception is CMMD1/D1-1343/L_CC.tif, which is 16 bits

For window values in DICOM file use full window width and SIGMOID function (since that is what GE uses), per:

  "http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.11.2.html#sect_C.11.2.1.3.1"

All are same matrix size that matches GE 24cm detector - assuming GE imager pixel spacing of 0.094090909 mm, since this is a required attribute

Not all images have metadata (esp. in D2 set) but those that don't have siblings (e.g., side with tumor) that do so use that

Use year as date and make 1st of Jan (and when year is missing making it 1901)

No time so use 000000

Use age as supplied

Assume sex is female

Use SCT (rather than SRT) codes for anatomy and view per CP 1850 - this may cause older mammo workstations that have not been upgraded to fail

Converted files comply with DICOM standard (and pass dciodvfy) per:

  "http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.27.html"

They do NOT comply with the IHE Mammo Display profile, which requires additional demographic, device and acquisition metadata for clinical and QC purposes - no way to recreate these from supplied metadata (i.e., fail dciodvfy with "-profile IHEMammo" option)

Converted files can be viewed in mammography workstation simulator in PixelMed Java DICOM toolkit (com.pixelmed.display.MammoImageViewer)

 - a screenshot of one of the converted subjects is included as an example of how the converted metadata is used for layout and demographic/technique annotation

Script depends on:

 - dicom3tools - "http://www.dclunie.com/dicom3tools.html"
 - netpbm (for tifftopnm) - "http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/"


You need to compile dicom3tools from source to get pnmtodc, ancreate, and dcmerge, since a valid root UID is required.
